# Google_Location_Tracker
Tracks your location and gives notification once destination is hit. WIP

The app uses google apis and its objective of tracking location and giving a notification of when you reach your destination is sort of a 
dumbed-down Google Maps. The purpose of this is to familiarize myself with the Google APIs rather than produce a practical application.
